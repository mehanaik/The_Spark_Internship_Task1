# The_Sparks_Foundation_GRIP_Internship_Task1
This repository is been created for the task documents of my internship at The Sparks Foundation
Task1-Prediction using Supervised ML.
In this task I've predicted the percentage of a student based on the number of his study hours. 
I used the concepts of data visualization, linear regression and building models for prediction.
